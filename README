pip install requirements.txt

data_analyzer.py

Contains the actual algorithm and data analysis for activity
detection. The report/algorithm explanation can be found within
the comments. The file is executable and will report results
as requested.

speed.py

speed.py is a separate tool created to report the magnitude of
the average velocity vector from acceleration. It was calculated
using the formula: int(a(t)dt, 0, t), 
where a(t) = ax(t) + ay(t) + az(t)

graph.py

To design the algorithm descriped in data_analyzer.py, we first
graphed the data visually, to help understand what features of 
each activity the algorithm could look for. To see these graphs
for yourself, run graph.py.

Please note that the program will open all the graphs in your
web browser at one.
